# web_scraping_NBA_missed_games

For this project I scraped basketballreference.com, wikepedia.com, realgm.com and hoopshype.com for NBA player data. Data was from the last 20 NBA season (1998-1999 to 2017-2018). Data focused on games played, games missed, player salary, player height and player weight. I wanted to analyze the correlation between player height/weight and missed games. I also wanted to see what teams have lost the most money due to missed games by players. I used Scrapy to scrape all four websites. I used Python to clean, manipulate and analyze data.
